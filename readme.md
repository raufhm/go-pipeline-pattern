# Pipeline Pattern in Go

The pipeline pattern in Go is a powerful approach for processing data in a sequential and efficient manner. It involves breaking down a task into smaller, independent stages (or components) that are executed concurrently, with each stage responsible for a specific operation on the data.

## Scenarios Where Pipeline Pattern is Useful

1. **Data Processing**: When you have a series of data processing steps that need to be executed sequentially, such as filtering, transforming, or aggregating data.

2. **Concurrency**: When you want to leverage Go's concurrency features (goroutines and channels) to perform parallel processing of data while ensuring that the order of operations is maintained.

3. **Modularity**: When you want to break down a complex data processing task into smaller, more manageable components, each responsible for a specific stage of processing.

4. **Scalability**: When you need to scale your data processing pipeline to handle large volumes of data efficiently by distributing the workload across multiple stages and utilizing multiple CPU cores.

5. **Real-time Processing**: When you need to process data in real-time or near real-time, such as processing streaming data from sensors, logs, or event streams.

6. **Testing and Maintenance**: When you want to improve the testability and maintainability of your code by encapsulating each stage of processing into separate functions or modules.
